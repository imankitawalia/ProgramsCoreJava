First, create a new table named employees_audit to keep the changes to the employees table:

CREATE TABLE employees_audit (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employeeNumber INT NOT NULL,
    lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    changedat DATETIME DEFAULT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL
);

Next, create a BEFORE UPDATE trigger that is invoked before a change is made to the employees table.

CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_update
    BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
 INSERT INTO employees_audit
 SET action = 'update',
     employeeNumber = OLD.employeeNumber,
     lastname = OLD.lastname,
     changedat = NOW();

Inside the body of the trigger, we used the OLD keyword to access values of the columns employeeNumber and lastname of the row affected by the trigger.

Then, show all triggers in the current database by using the SHOW TRIGGERS statement:

SHOW TRIGGERS;
